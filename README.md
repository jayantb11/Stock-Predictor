1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Two datasets are loaded, one for Tesla and another for Google, using the `pd.read_csv` function.
   - The `info()` and `head()` functions are used to check the data types and display the first few rows of the Tesla dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing for Tesla:**
   - The 'Date' column in the Tesla dataset is converted to a datetime format using `pd.to_datetime`.
   - Descriptive statistics are calculated using the `describe()` function.
   - Box plots for the columns 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', and 'Adj Close' are plotted using `plot(kind='box')`.

3. **Data Visualization for Tesla using Plotly:**
   - The Plotly library is imported for interactive data visualization.
   - A line plot for Tesla closing prices over time is created using Plotly.

4. **Linear Regression Model for Tesla:**
   - The `LinearRegression` model from scikit-learn is used to create a simple linear regression model for predicting Tesla stock prices based on the day.
   - The model is trained on the 'Close' prices, and the actual vs. predicted values are plotted.

5. **Deep Learning Model (LSTM) for Google Stock Prediction:**
   - Data for Google stock prices is loaded and processed for LSTM model training.
   - MinMax scaling is applied to the 'Close' prices.
   - A sequential LSTM model is built with four LSTM layers and a dense output layer.
   - The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss.
   - The model is trained for 20 epochs using historical stock prices.

6. **Model Evaluation and Loss Plotting:**
   - Training loss for the LSTM model is plotted to visualize the training progress.

7. **Testing the LSTM Model on Google Test Data:**
   - The LSTM model is used to predict the stock prices on the test data.
   - The predicted prices are inverse transformed to get them back to the original scale.
   - Actual vs. predicted stock prices for Google are plotted.

8. **Plotting Results:**
   - The actual and predicted Google stock prices are visualized using matplotlib.

These key points summarize the main steps and visualizations performed in the provided code.
