# Stock-Predictor
A stock predictor using machine learning algorithm 

•	Data Pre-processing and Scaling: Pre-processed stock market data from a CSV file, handling missing values by coercing the 'Close' column to numeric format.
•	LSTM Model Architecture: Implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for stock price prediction.
•	Model Training: Trained the LSTM model using historical stock price data with a total of 20 epochs and a batch size of 32.
•	Prediction and Visualization: Visualized the actual stock prices and predicted stock prices using Matplotlib, providing a clear comparison in the plot.
